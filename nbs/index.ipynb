    "In the spirit of [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming), I'll be posting about the process of running a fine-tuned LLM (large language model) entirely on my phone, and the things I learn along the way. \n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are notoriously resource-intensive. They're usually trained and deployed on powerful hardware like GPUs, which are expensive and hard to come by. However, there are tools, techniques, and open-source models out there make it possible to run inference on the average personal device, like your phone!\n",
