    "text": "Welcome to my new blog!\nIn the spirit of literate programming, I’ll be posting about the process of running a fine-tuned LLM (large language model) entirely on my phone, and the things I learn along the way.\nLLMs are notoriously resource-intensive. They’re usually trained and deployed on powerful hardware like GPUs, which are expensive and hard to come by. However, there are tools, techniques, and open-source models out there make it possible to run inference on the average personal device, like your phone!\nI don’t have any prior experience in AI/ML. I’m taking a beginner-friendly class with Chris Kroenke as a part of Fractal University this fall. Let’s figure this out together!\n\n*speaking relatively lol"
